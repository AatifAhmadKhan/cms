# CMS Blog System

This is a basic ***CRUD*** System with all the functionalities of a content Management system:

- Post Management
- Category Management
- User Management
- Comment Management
- Profile Management

Register yourself via the "Signup" menu and then login to the admin panel. There all the Posts, Categories, Comments and users can be managed.

The backend is built by ***<u>PHP</u>*** and mobile responsiveness is handled by ***<u>Bootstrap</u>*** Framework.

For the database I have used ***<u>MySQL</u>*** .

The admin area is not mobile responsive, since an app can be developed specifically for managing the content of the website by the admin.

List of the technologies used:
- PHP
- MySQL
- Bootstrap
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery
